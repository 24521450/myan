# ===========================================================================
# Phrasal Verb Folding (Issue A, option β)
# ===========================================================================
# Oxford's main-word page for pattern-heavy verbs (deprive, derive, devote,
# rely) is a stub that links to a separate phrasal-verb page (e.g. "deprive of").
# After fetching the phrasal-verb page, we want the main word to OWN the
# phrasal-verb definitions so the Anki deck shows a single card per headword
# (matching how OALD presents it).
#
# Detection: a phrasal-verb record has `pos == ["phrasal verb"]` and `word`
# contains a space (e.g. "deprive of", "rely on"). The base word is the
# first whitespace-separated token.
#
# Fold operation (pre-grouping):
#   1. Find all phrasal-verb records.
#   2. For each, locate the main-word record (same `word` = base).
#   3. Append the phrasal-verb's `pos_data` (with pos="phrasal verb") to the
#      main-word record's pos_data.
#   4. Append the phrasal-verb record to a `folded_sources` list on the main
#      word (for traceability / source_files union).
#   5. Flag the phrasal-verb record `_skip: true, _skip_reason:
#      "folded-into-main-word: <base>"` so the builder doesn't render a
#      duplicate card.
#
# If the main-word record doesn't exist for some reason (shouldn't happen
# given the cache structure, but defensive), keep the phrasal-verb record
# as-is and don't fold.
